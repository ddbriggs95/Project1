# TinDawg

TinDawg is a website that provides information about different breeds of dogs and their availability for adoption. The website uses two APIs, [Dogs API-API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/api/dogs) and [dog.ceo-Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/breeds-list) to gather information about the breeds and check their availability for adoption.

## About the Developers

TinDawg was developed by (Alphabetically ordered) **Alec Marierose**, **Dowling Briggs**, **Parisa Darkhal** and **Tyler Prouty** as a part of Georgia Tech FSF Bootcamp Projects. As dog lovers, they wanted to create a website that could help other dog lovers find information about different breeds and potentially adopt a new furry friend.
